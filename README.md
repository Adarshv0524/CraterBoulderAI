### Author: *Adarsh Kumar Verma*

### Objective
The main objective is to automatically detect craters and boulders in Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC) images using advanced AI/ML techniques.

### Solution Overview
This solution leverages a two-stage Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately identify and localize craters and boulders in OHRC images. The process involves data preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, deployment, post-processing, and continuous monitoring.

### Approach

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**
   - Collect OHRC images.
   - Preprocess images using OpenCV for noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and segmentation to improve feature visibility.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Create and train a custom CNN model.
   - Optionally integrate transfer learning using pre-trained networks like ResNet or Inception to enhance accuracy.

3. **Training:**
   - Employ data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments.
   - Utilize GPU acceleration with CUDA for efficient processing of large datasets.
   - Optimize the model using focal loss to handle class imbalance between craters and boulders.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model based on metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and Intersection over Union (IoU).
   - Implement feedback loops to retrain and fine-tune the model as necessary.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Develop a user-friendly Python-based interface for researchers.
   - Optimize for inference speed using Flask or FastAPI.
   - Deploy on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

6. **Post-Processing:**
   - Visualize detected features using OpenCV.
   - Perform statistical analysis of identified craters and boulders to gain insights into surface characteristics.

7. **Monitoring & Maintenance:**
   - Implement continuous monitoring and maintenance using tools like the ELK stack, Prometheus, and Grafana to ensure system performance and reliability.
